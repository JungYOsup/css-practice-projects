        <h3>OSAKA</h3>
        <section>
          Osaka City (Osaka City) is a city in Osaka Prefecture, Japan, located
          in Osaka Bay on the Yodogawa River estuary of Honshu Kinki region.
          Osaka City is also designated as an ordinance-designated city by the
          Japanese Local Autonomy Law and is the seat of the Osaka Prefectural
          Government. Osaka is historically Japan's commercial center and the
          heart of Japan's second largest gay Hanshin metropolitan area. The
          weekly population is second only to Tokyo, followed by Japan, followed
          by Yokohama at night. In 1956, it was designated as the first
          government designated city in Japan. It is the largest non-Kanto
          region, and it is a place where many Koreans live together. Kono Hana
          Ward has the Universal Athletics Championships in Japan and abroad,
          and the 2007 World Championships in Athletics.

        <h3>INFROMATION</h3>
        <section>
          <ul>
            <li>
              ■ A tourist who visited Osaka last September said in a sushi
              restaurant, "The sushi restaurant employees intentionally made fun
              of us who were suffering from the sushi we ordered by adding a lot
              of Wasabi," adding, "The employees used the expressions of '춍' in
              Japanese." '춍' is used to describe the Korean people as being
              disparaged or ridiculed by the Japanese, and is generally used to
              call them down.
            </li>
            <li>
              ■ It was criticized when it was belatedly discovered that
              employees at a ticket office of Hankyubus, a bus company in Osaka,
              defiled Korean tourists in April. When a ticket agent asked for
              his name while a South Korean tourist purchased the bus ticket, he
              briefly replied, "Kim," and an employee on the bus ticket labeled
              his name "Kim Yeon." According to Mainichi Broadcasting in Japan,
              the staff who issued the bus ticket is a female employee in her
              20s and is not good at Korean, so I think there was no malice.
            </li>
            <li>
              ■ On the 10th, there was a discriminatory announcement on the
              Nankai subway that runs from Namba to Kansai Airport, saying, "I'm
              sorry for causing inconvenience to Japanese passengers because I'm
              very crowded today." As controversy intensified as the person in
              his 40s, Nankai Electric said on Tuesday that it will punish the
              deputy director who apologized to foreign passengers aboard the
              subway and aired the information.
            </li>
            <li>
              ■ A 13-year-old Japanese man who visited Japan for a family trip
              in the famous tourist resort of Osaka, Dotonbori, suddenly
              launched a kick-off attack on a 13-year-old Korean boy.
            </li>
            <li>
              ■ Two Korean women who were traveling to the famous tourist resort
              of Osaka, Japan, Dotonbori, reported on the 12th that four
              Japanese youths followed and abused each other while filming a
              video clip. The video footage taken by the real people showed men
              swearing at the cameras, calling them "Kill Korea dead." Following
              the series of reports, South Korean consulate general Zuosaka said
              in a notice on its website on Monday, "We have recently received
              cases where Korean people have been damaged during the nighttime
              in Dotonbori, a major tourist destination in Osaka," adding,
              "Please be aware of the safety of those who visit during the
              night." Source: 시 [Source: Vision News] [Card News] An unusual
